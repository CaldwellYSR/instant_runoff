# Instant Runoff CLI Script
Python 2.7 Script for taking a votes csv and outputting a winner using [Instant Runoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting)

To use the script, copy the `votes.csv` and input your own voting stats. Each row after the first will represent a single voter's ranking.
Once you have a csv in the same folder as the script simply type `python processing.py [filename.csv]` and the script will output the winner.
